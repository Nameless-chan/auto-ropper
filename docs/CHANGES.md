# V1
It is now able to do pretty much everything by itself:
* Leak offset
* Leak address
* Find and download libc
* Pwn
However you still need to edit the file to change the path and name for the binary you want to pwn. It'll be fixed in future version.<br>
It also cannot access online binary, but that'll be fixed too sooner than later.
